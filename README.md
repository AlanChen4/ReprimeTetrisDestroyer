Tetris Bot for 2 player mode on http://regprime.com/Games/Tetris2Play

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how simple requests can be made to manulipate and simulate web behavior. When the game is normally played, a web request is sent to the website detailing game information (number of lines cleared, current height, etc.). By using the requests module, these web requests can be replicated and edited so that custom game information can be inputted. As such, the user can send a web request stating that a total of five lines had been cleared, without having to actually clear any lines. 

## Tutorial
**Choice** input: Chooses game mode that the bot will play. Game mode 1 is for when the bot is hosting the game, and game mode 2 is when the bot is joining a game. 

**Number of lines** input: This is the number of lines that will be sent to the other player on every 5 second interval.
